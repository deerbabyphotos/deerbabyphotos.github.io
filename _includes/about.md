Hello, my name is Julia.  I’m a photographer based in Bushwick,
Brooklyn.
 
I’m originally from Germany. I live here with my wonderful husband, 
my little baby Clementine, and my crazy dog Lola.
I have a masters degree in photography and years of experience. 
My style is authentic, editorial and real.
I absolutely love my job and strive to create meaningful memories in
your life. Photographing babies and newborns has become one of my favorite things in the world! If you are interested in doing a baby session with me, please get in touch with me: julia@deerbabyphoto.com. Hope to meet your little one soon!
