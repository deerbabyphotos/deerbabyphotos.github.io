Hello, my name is Julia.  I’m a photographer based in Bushwick,
Brooklyn.
 
I’m originally from Germany. I live here with my wonderful husband, 
my little baby Clementine, and my crazy dog Lola.
I have a masters degree in photography and years of experience. 
My style is authentic, editorial and real.
I absolutely love my job and strive to create meaningful memories in
your life.
