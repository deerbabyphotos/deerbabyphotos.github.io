I like it simple! So I offer two different packages for my sessions:


### **Newborn Session** $300

The fee includes:

- A session that takes place in the comfort of your home (or my studio if you prefer)
- A 60 minute session with your newborn (photos with parents not included)
- All edited photos (typically around 100, a mix of color & BW) uploaded to a password protected online gallery (no watermarks)
- All edited photos (typically around 100, a mix of color & BW) in high resolution (no watermarks) on a memory stick within 10 days of the session
- A phone/email consultation before the session to discuss planning, expectations, wardrobe, etc.


### **Family Session** $450

The fee includes:

- A session that takes place in the comfort of your home (or my studio if you prefer)
- A 120 minute session with your baby and all family members. Pets are welcome too. :-)
- All edited photos (typically around 200, a mix of color & BW) uploaded to a password protected online gallery (no watermarks)
- All edited photos (typically around 200, a mix of color & BW) in high resolution (no watermarks) on a memory stick, within 10 days of the session
- A phone/email consultation before the session to discuss planning, expectations, wardrobe, etc. 


### What else?

I will bring a variety of blankets and wraps. Please let me know if the natural light in your apartment is not great so I can bring lighting equipment. 

No travel fee within Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Queens.  Outside of these boroughs a travel fee may apply. **Hello Bushwick babies!** There is a $50 discount on all packages if your shoot takes place in my hood! 

There is a $50 weekend surcharge for both packages.
 
I also have a small studio in Bushwick that can be made available upon request. 

I’m also available to shoot birthday parties, ceremonies, and other family gatherings. Please also ask me about my maternity shoots!

The ideal time for a newborn session is within the first 10 days of life, but of course we can take beautiful photos at any time.  Would you like photos of your newborn also at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at his/her 1st year baby party? I’d love to meet your little one every 3 months, so please ask me about a special discounted package rate for a 1 year baby session subscription!
