I like it simple! So I only offer two different packages for my sessions:

**Newborn Session** $300

This is a session that focuses on your little one only:

_ a session that takes place in the comfort of your home
- a 60 minute session with your newborn only (no photos with parents, siblings included!)
- all edited photos (about 100, a mix of color & BW) uploaded to a password protected online gallery (no watermarks)
- all edited photos (about 100, a mix of color & BW) in high resolution (no watermarks) on a memory stick, within 10 days of the session
- a phone/email consultation before the session to discuss planning, expectations, wardrobe..._


**Family Session** $450

This session is great for photos of your little one plus many family photos!

_ a session that takes place in the comfort of your home
- a 120 minute session with all your family members. Pets are welcome too. :-)
- all edited photos (about 200, a mix of color & BW) uploaded to a password protected online gallery (no watermarks)
- all edited photos (about 200, a mix of color & BW) in high resolution (no watermarks) on a memory stick, within 10 days of the session
- a phone/email consultation before the session to discuss planning, expectations, wardrobe..._


**What else?**

I will bring a variety of blankets and wraps. Please let me know if the natural light in your apartment is not great, so I can bring lighting equipment. 

Travel fee may apply depending upon your location.
No fee within Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens.

There is a weekend surcharge for both packages: $50
 
I also have a small studio in Bushwick that can be made available upon
request. 

I can also be hired to shoot birthday parties, baptism ceremonies, and
other family gatherings

An ideal time for a newborn session is within the first 10 days of life, but of course we can take beautiful photos at any time. Please also ask me about my package rate for a 1 year baby session subscription! Would you like photos of your newborn also at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at his/her 1st year baby party? I love meeting your little one every 3 months, so please ask me about a special discount for that!
