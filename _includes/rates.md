I like it simple! So my session fee is all inclusive:  __$400__ for weekdays
and __$450__ for weekends.

The session will take place in the comfort of your home and it includes

-  _my time and expertise during the shoot and post-processing
- _a 90 minute session
- _all edited images uploaded to a password protected online gallery (no watermarks)
- _all edited photos in high resolution (no watermarks) on a memory stick, within 10 days of the session
- _a phone consultation before the session to discuss planning, expectations, wardrobe...


Travel fee may apply depending upon your location.
No fee within Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens.

 
I also have a small studio in Bushwick that can be made available upon
request. 

I can also be hired to shoot birthday parties, baptism ceremonies, and
other family gatherings
