I like it simple! So my baby photography session fee is all inclusive:  __$400__ for weekdays
and __$450__ for weekends.

The session will take place in the comfort of your home and it includes

-  _my time and expertise during the shoot and post-processing
- _a 90 minute session with your newborn and family
- _all edited photos uploaded to a password protected online gallery (no watermarks)
- _all edited photos in high resolution (no watermarks) on a memory stick, within 10 days of the session
_ _the family will receive about 100 - 150 photos, which are a mix of color and B&W
- _a phone consultation before the session to discuss planning, expectations, wardrobe...

I will bring a variety of blankets and wraps. Please let me know if the natural light in your apartment is not great, so I can bring lighting equipment. 

Travel fee may apply depending upon your location.
No fee within Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens.

 
I also have a small studio in Bushwick that can be made available upon
request. 

I can also be hired to shoot birthday parties, baptism ceremonies, and
other family gatherings

An ideal time for a newborn session is within the first 10 days of life, but of course we can take beautiful photos at any time. Please also ask me about my package rate for a 1 year baby session subscription! Would you like photos of your newborn also at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and at his/her 1st year baby party? I love meeting your little one every 3 months, so please ask me about a special discount for that!
